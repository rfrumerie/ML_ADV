To produce the PCA plot, MDS plot (no weights) and IsoMap plot (k=13), just run the entire code.
To get MDS with weight, the weights in the MDS section had to be used (comented out at start).
To get IsoMap plot for different k-values, change it at the top of the IsoMap section.
The code was written in Jupyter notebook.
